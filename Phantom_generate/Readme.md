In this folder, we provide the simulated training data CODE for RLN.  
 
The code is with Matlab 2014  

You can use the Phantom_generate.m to generate the ground truths. You can set the structure size as you want.  
You can use Generation_of_input.m to blur the ground truth with correspondng PSF and add different level noise.
